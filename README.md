* Allowing users to define and view the top N most populated countries, cities, and capital cities.
* Offering population distribution insights by continent, region, country, and city.
* Presenting statistics on major language speakers, including Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, and Arabic.

## System Features

1.  **Report Generation**
    * Retrieve and display country, city, and capital city data sorted by population.
    * Generate user-defined top N reports for countries, cities, and capital cities.
